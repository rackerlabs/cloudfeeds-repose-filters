# Custom Repose filters for Cloud Feeds

This component contains custom Repose filters which provide functionality 
required by Cloud Feeds in addition to the standard Repose filters.

## json-xml-filter
This filter is in the chain if the POST request contains request body in JSON
(content-type is vnd.rackspace.atom+json). 

This filter reads the JSON Atom request body and produces an XML equivalent.
